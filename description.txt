This is a game called Alien Invasion. In this game, the player controls a
rocket ship that appears at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the 
rocket ship left and right using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens appears towards the top of
the screen and begins to move towards the rocket ship. It is the player's job
to then shoot and destroy the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a
new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. 
If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
